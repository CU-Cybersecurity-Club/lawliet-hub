why is ipv6 necessary? the htb vpn requires ipv6
https://forum.hackthebox.eu/discussion/385/fatal-error

to enable ipv6 in the docker daemon AND in the docker container, you need to both edit the daemon config and the sysctls for docker run

running a vpn in docker requires the NET_ADMIN cap
I think that because it is in bridge mode, there shouldn't (?) be a vuln, though this may require creating networks for every container? DONT RUN IN HOST NETWORK MODE otherwise definitely a vuln

  To control a container's CPU usage, you can use the
  --cpu-period  and --cpu-quota options with the docker 
  create and docker run commands  from version 1.7.0 of Docker onward.

  The --cpu-quota option specifies the number of microseconds 
  that a container has access to CPU resources during a 
  period specified by --cpu-period.
  As the default value of --cpu-period is 100000, setting the 
  value of --cpu-quota to 25000 limits a container to 25% of 
  the CPU resources. By default, a container can use all available CPU resources, 
  which corresponds to a --cpu-quota value of -1.
